This is a very basic static site generator that I use to generate my personal website. 

Instructions:
1. Put pages you want (index.html, projects.html etc.) in `resources/pages`
2. Put other assets and base HTMl template in `resources`
3. Run `main` function in `Generator.kt`
4. Static site files will be outputted to root-level `docs` directory
